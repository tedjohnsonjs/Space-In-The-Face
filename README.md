# Space In The Face 
Space In The Face is a fun little arcade-style shoot-em-up I made using the HTML canvas element. The objective of the game is to simply wipe out the alien force descending from above.

## Getting Started 
 
If you want to mess around with the code on your own local machine, it's really easy to set up the development env. 
 
### Prerequisites 
 
All work is done in pure HTML and JavaScript. There are no libraries used in the project. 
 
### Developing 
 
The entirety of the game is located in the [javascript.js](javascript.js) file, with basic canvas setup and styling located in the [index.html](index.html). All game resources are located in the [resources folder](resources). 
 
### Testing locally 
 
Simply open index.html in any browser that supports the HTML canvas element, and the game should start to run.
