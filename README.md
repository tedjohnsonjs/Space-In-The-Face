# Space-In-The-Face
Space In The Face is a fun little arcade-style shoot-em-up I made using the HTML canvas element. The object of the game is to simply wipe out the alien force descending from above. Your two ships are equipped with the finest military-grade space guns around. But there's a catch. To provide enough power to launch the projectiles, your ship must be moving forward in order to fire...

In total, it took me three school days to perfect the gameplay. Adding power ups was a choice I made towards the end, and I think it was definitely worth it. They make for some interesting moments, especially getting the shield and speed perks at the same time. I tried to make it as easily modifiable as possible, for my sake mainly. I really had to fiddle around with all constants when trying to balance the game.

Currently, there are no sounds or music in the game, but I plan to add them fairly soon (Once I'm a bit better at sound production). Another feature I'm interested in adding is a global leaderboard. There's already a score system (but no highscore recording), so all I would need to do is use NodeJS to save scores and names to a Mongo database. Right now, this is beyond the scope of this project, but I can always come back and and them in later.

In the end, I think it turned out pretty good. I almost got into the problem where I was play testing more than developing, so I kinda slowed towards the end!
